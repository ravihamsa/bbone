# IBone
***
IBone is a framework that is being developed on top of very popular and widely adopted Backbone JS, obligating flexibility, scalability and high-performance as core principles. With IBone common boiler-plate code is not needed any more, and developer can concentrate more on building user friendly uber-cool interactions rather than worrying about implementations rather than managing views, models and controllers.

IBone solves common patterns of Backbone usage and provide
*  Router that load and execute code on demand
*  Auto-wired listeners for watching model changes
*  Centralised view initialisation which have optimisation measures built in
*  Widgets like Form, DataTable and Chart which covers all common requirements of analytical applications
